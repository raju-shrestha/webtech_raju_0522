<h1>About Nepal<h1>
<p>
Over the years, cultures and traditions from different parts of Nepal have intermingled at its capital.
 The art and architecture of the Kathmandu Valley is distinctly flavored by this intellectual mix.
 At the center of the valley lies Basantapur Durbar Square. The Malla kings built the square between
 12th and the 18th century AD and houses innumerable pagodas, courtyards, temples and the Kumari
 House (abode of the Living Goddess). The Pashupatinath Temple, an abode of Lord Shiva lies about
 5 km northeast of the center by the airport. Swayambhunath Stupa, the holiest shrine for Buddhists
 in Nepal sits on Padmachala hill 3 km to the west of the city center. Boudhanath Stupa, the largest 
 stupa rising 36 metres falls along the ancient trade route between Kathmandu and Lhasa, in Tibet 4 km
 northwest of the Durbar Square. Thamel, is the main tourist hub where anyone can find innumerable ways
 to have fun. 
 There are several places such as Nagarkot, Dhulikhel, Kirtipur, Daman around the valley that offer visitors with an
 excellent panorama of the Himalayan range and serve as an excellent location to get away from the hustle and bustle
 of the city. Nepal is a country of great topographical diversities. The altitude in the country varies from less than 
 70m above sea level at Kechana Kalan of Jhapa to the world’s highest point 8, 848m at the summit of Mt. Everest. 
 This variation occurs at the distance of less than 300kms.
