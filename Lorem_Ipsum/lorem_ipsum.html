<p>Web Page:  
A web page is a document or information resource that is suitable for the World Wide Web and can be accessed through a web browser 
and displayed on a monitor or mobile device.
This information is usually in HTML or XHTML format, and may provide navigation to other web pages via hypertext links. Web pages 
frequently subsume other resources such as style sheets, scripts and images into their final presentation. 
Web pages may be retrieved from a local computer or from a remote web server. The web server may restrict access only to a private
 network.e.g. a corporate intranet, or it may publish pages on the World Wide Web.
Web pages are requested and served from web servers using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). 
Web pages may consist of files of static text and other content stored within the web server's file system (static web pages), 
or may be constructed by server-side software when they are requested (dynamic web pages). Client-side scripting can make web 
pages more responsive to user input once on the client browser. 

<p>
Web Site:  
A website or simply site, is a collection of related web pages containing images, videos or other digital assets.
A website is hosted on at least one web server, accessible via a network such as the Internet or a private local 
area network through an Internet address known as a Uniform Resource Locator. All publicly accessible websites 
collectively constitute the World Wide Web. Web sites can be static or dynamic. 

<p> 
Static Website: 
A static website is one that has web pages stored on the server in the format that is sent to a client web browser. 
It is primarily coded in Hypertext Markup Language, HTML. 
Simple forms or marketing examples of websites, such as classic website, a five-page website or a brochure website 
are often static websites, because they present pre-defined, static information to the user. This may include 
information about a company and its products and services via text, photos, animations, audio/video and interactive menus and navigation.
