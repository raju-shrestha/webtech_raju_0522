 This type of website usually displays the same information to all visitors. Similar to handing out a printed brochure to customers
  or clients, a static website will generally provide consistent, standard information for an extended period of time. Although the
  website owner may make updates periodically, it is a manual process to edit the text, photos and other content and may require
  basic website design skills and software.
 In summary, visitors are not able to control what information they receive via a static website, and must instead settle for whatever
  content the website owner has decided to offer at that time.

 Dynamic Website:
 A dynamic website is one that changes or customizes itself frequently and automatically, based on certain criteria.
 Dynamic websites can have two types of dynamic activity: Code and Content. Dynamic code is invisible or behind the scenes and dynamic
  content is visible or fully displayed.
 The first type is a web page with dynamic code. The code is constructed dynamically on the fly using active programming language instead
 of plain, static HTML.

 The second type is a website with dynamic content displayed in plain view. Variable content is displayed dynamically on the fly based
 on certain criteria, usually by retrieving content stored in a database
